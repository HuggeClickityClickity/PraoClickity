            Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
            We've known each other for so long
            Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it)
            Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)
            We know the game and we're gonna play it
            And if you ask me how I'm feeling
            Don't tell me you're too blind to see
            Never gonna give you up
